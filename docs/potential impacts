**Investing in Clinic Efficiency & Systems: ROI Support Document**

---

## 1. Executive Summary

To sustain and accelerate franchise growth, The Joint Chiropractic is evaluating an investment in enhanced clinic‐staff systems and workflows. By quantifying key performance indicators (KPIs) linked directly to royalty income (7% of gross sales) and operational cost savings, we can build a clear ROI model that demonstrates the financial and strategic value of this initiative.

## 2. Material KPIs for ROI Analysis

| KPI                                    | Definition & Relevance                                                                                                                |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Total Gross Sales**                  | Monthly or annual revenue per clinic. Drives 7% royalty stream (“ΔRoyalties”).                                                        |
| **Same-Store Sales Growth (YoY%)**     | Percentage change in sales at existing clinics. Indicates organic uplift attributable to system improvements.                         |
| **Average Revenue per Visit (ARPV)**   | Gross Sales ÷ Number of Visits. Higher ARPV amplifies royalty dollars.                                                                |
| **Number of Visits (per period)**      | Total patient encounters. Increased throughput raises both sales and royalties.                                                       |
| **Admin-Time per Visit**               | Average minutes staff spend on non-clinical tasks. Reduction frees capacity for additional visits and lowers labor expense.           |
| **Utilization Rate**                   | % of available appointment slots filled. Higher utilization translates into more visits without adding fixed costs.                   |
| **New Patient Acquisition Rate**       | Number of first-time patients per month. New patients broaden the visit base and future revenue streams.                              |
| **Patient Retention Rate (12-month%)** | % of patients who return within a year. Retention drives repeat visits and steadier revenue.                                          |
| **Ancillary Service Attachment Rate**  | % of visits incorporating add-on services (e.g., massage). Boosts ARPV and overall profitability.                                     |
| **Staff Net Promoter Score (NPS)**     | Likelihood of staff recommending their systems. Correlates with operational excellence, lower turnover, and faster clinic expansions. |
| **Training Time to Competency**        | Days required for new staff to reach full productivity. Shorter ramp-up reduces upfront costs and speeds ROI.                         |
| **Staff Turnover Rate**                | Annual % of staff departures. Lower turnover cuts recruiting/training expense and preserves service quality.                          |

## 3. ROI Formula & Variables

$$
\text{ROI} = \frac{\bigl(\Delta\text{Royalties} \;+\; \text{Cost Savings}\bigr) \;-\; \text{Investment Cost}}{\text{Investment Cost}}
$$

* **Investment Cost**

  * Software licenses, hardware, implementation services
  * Staff training & change-management expenses
  * Ongoing support/maintenance fees

* **ΔRoyalties** (= 7% × ΔGross Sales)

  * Projected uplift in same-store sales, ARPV, and visits (driven by efficiency gains)
  * Modeled over a defined horizon (e.g., 3 years)

* **Cost Savings**

  * Labor cost reduction from decreased admin time
  * Lower turnover & recruiting/training expense
  * Reduced error/write-off costs from billing improvements

* **Time Horizon**

  * Payback period calculation (e.g., months to recoup investment)
  * Net present value (NPV) using corporate discount rate

## 6. Summary & Recommendations

1. **Payback Period**

   * **Investment**: \$50K per clinic average (system rollout, training, hardware)
   * **Annual Benefit**: ΔRoyalties (\$17K) + Cost Savings (\$8K) = \$25K
   * **Payback**: \~2 years

2. **Strategic Benefits**

   * Fosters faster multi-unit expansions as ROI proof points accumulate
   * Improves staff satisfaction (higher NPS), reducing turnover risks and closures
   * Strengthens corporate royalty growth via both new-clinic and same-store channels

3. **Next Steps**

   * **Pilot**: Select 10–15 clinics, instrument baseline KPIs, deploy new systems, and measure actual uplifts over 6 months.
   * **Refine Model**: Validate assumptions, adjust training protocols, and finalize rollout budget.
   * **Scale & Incentivize**: Tie franchise expansion incentives to documented KPI improvements, accelerating multi-unit growth.

By anchoring the ROI calculation in concrete, measurable KPI improvements—and validating with a controlled pilot—The Joint can confidently invest in advanced clinic systems, secure rapid payback, and drive sustained royalty revenue growth.
